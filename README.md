# SortingAlgorithmsVisualization
Visualizing Bubble-sort, Insertion-sort, Selection-sort, Shell-sort, Merge-sort, Heap-sort, Quick-sort

This is a simple program visualizing the most common sorting algorithms used.
It was created to better understand the importance of optimized applications by visualizing the immence diffenerence between algorithms made for the exact same purpose.

## Setting up
### Linux
<b> 1. </b> Install SFML using <i>sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev</i>

<b> 2. </b> Run command <i>make br</i> (See "MakeFile")

### Windows
<b> 1. </b> Download SFML-dev pack from <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php">here</a>

<b> 2. </b> Compile the .exe-file using roughly the same command as <i>make br</i> in "MakeFile" but change the .lib-location to where you put the files

### Mac
Should be similar to Linux ;)
