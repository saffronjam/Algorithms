# SortingAlgorithmsVisualization
Visualizing Bubble-sort, Insertion-sort, Selection-sort, Shell-sort, Merge-sort, Heap-sort, Quick-sort

This is a simple program visualizing the most common sorting algorithms used.
It was created to better understand the importance of optimized applications by visualizing the immence diffenerence between algorithms made for the exact same purpose.

## Setting up
### Linux
<b> 1. </b> Install SFML using apt-get in your terminal
<b> 2. </b> Run command "make br" (See "MakeFile")

### Windows
<b> 1. </b> Download SFML-dev pack from <a>https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php</a>
<b> 2. </b> Compile the .exe-file using the same command as "make br" in "MakeFile" but change the .lib-location to where you put the files

### Mac
##### Should be similar to Linux ;)
