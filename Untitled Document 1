BarContainer:
 - Holds all bars
 - Draws all bars
 - Doesnt need a reference to anything (BASE)

Sorting Classes:
 - Holds reference to bars (bars value) and sort them, color them based on sorting type etc.
 - Needs reference to BarContiner ("DERIVED")

SortingController:
 - Choses which sorting algorithm is active
 - Resets sorting if necessary (changing sort = reset)
 - Needs reference to Sorting Classes to make them active/reset them/hide them etc. ("DERIVED")
